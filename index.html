      <h4>Why Hashreds for your Github username?</h4>
      <p>
        My favorite breakfast food has for many years been hashbrowns, but unfortunately 
        "hashbrowns" was not available when I made my Github account. So hashreds somehow came to mind
        as the closest thing to hashbrowns, and here we are.
